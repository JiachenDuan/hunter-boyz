# Claude Instructions — Hunter Boyz

## Workflow (mandatory)

After every fix or feature:
1. **Commit the changes** with a clear message describing what was fixed/added.
2. **Update `HUNTER_BOYZ.md`** — add the change under the relevant section (or create a new one).
   - Include: what was broken/missing, how it was fixed, any tuning knobs or gotchas.

Do not skip either step, even for small fixes.
